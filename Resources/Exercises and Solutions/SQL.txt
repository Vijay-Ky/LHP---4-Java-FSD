SQL stands for Structured Query Language is a domain specific programming language for managing the data in Database Management Systems. SQL programming skills are highly desirable and required in the market, as there is a massive use of Database Management Systems (DBMS) in almost every software application. In order to get a job, candidates need to crack the interview in which they are asked various SQL interview questions.
Following is a curated list of SQL interview questions and answers, which are likely to be asked during the SQL interview. Candidates are likely to be asked basic SQL interview questions to advance level SQL questions depending on their experience and various other factors.
